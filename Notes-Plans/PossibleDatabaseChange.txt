Trying to make database queries more efficient.

Will move legends into own table. Make sure deaths table is not called upon often for it is huge.

wServer will manage the legends table every x minutes using a similar system as AutoSave.

server will use the listing in legends table. Also when glows are checked when player initializes will the legends table be utilized.

Legends table is already made.

ManageLegends query is WIP.

wServer timed query is not started.

server GetLegends query is not started.
