# This is the Phoenix Realms Reborn Source, fully equipped with client, database, and server. #

At the moment, everything essential works except for account verification which can only be done with a proper website.

Please use XAMPP to run the MySQL server. It is recommended to run the whole query of struct.sql in order to make sure the system gets properly included.

Email handler still requires a dummy email and a website.

Client needs recoloring and possibly new UI images.

Server needs a ton of content, but is overall stable.

clienttest.bat is meant to open the TestingClient straight from the output folder!

obfuscator.bat is meant to open the obfuscator straight from the output folder!

The flash projector in the project is needed for both BAT files to work properly! Please don't move it.
